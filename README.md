# Bachelor_thesis
My bachelor thesis is about bicategories in noncommutative geometry! 
In particular, it deals with covariant representations of twisted (partial) group actions on rings.
Of course, everything in the language of bicategory! :)

First, I start with the concept of bicategory and covariance rings.   
A bicategory is something like a category of categories with some weaked conditions.  
The concept of covariance rings is introduced by my supervisor Ralf Meyer.
It is a ring with the universal property so that it captures all covrariant representations of twisted (partial) group actions.  
There are two variation of covariance rings, namely lax covariance rings and strong covariance rings.
A lax covariance ring captures all 'lax' covariant representations that are somewhat simple representations.
A strong covariance ring caputures all strong covariant representations that behaves better than the lax ones.

It is easier to understand lax covariance rings because lax covariant representations are simple.
We know even in which condition lax covariance rings exist.  


But ,in general, it is not know in which condition strong covariance rings exist.
In my thesis, I have shown that twisted partial group actions with an enveloping action do admit a strong covariance ring!
Shortly, if a twisted partial action is a restriction of a twisted group action, it admits a strong covariance ring!


Furthermore, I provide various examples of lax and strong covariance rings.
Leavitt path algebras and Steinberg algebras appears as common examples of them.

It is pretty fun to look noncommutative geometry and algebra with the perspective of bicategory.
